 <h1>This page will help you in selecting your device.</h1>   
 <p class="paragraph">There are no such specified laptops for coading, you can also code on a device having minimum specification. 
  <br>Only thing that you have to keep in your mind that you might be running some heavy softwares like android studio and other at the same time which needs a little higher end cpu and gpu to do so.
  <br>Devices are listed below with there specifications and other details along with the price and buy links, after going through all the devices you will be get a comparision and at the last which should be preferred more than others.</p>

   <h1>   Why this <i class="fa-brands fa-glide"></i>uide?</h1>
       <p>The most important and required thing for a coder or a programmer is a laptop. We can also code in destops but as laptops come with the ease of portability. Some might argue that the most important is brain/logic understanding etc., indeed it is, but what's the use of a potential if it can't be drawn out.
       There is a lot of confusion while choosing a laptop as there are numberous of companies providing numberous of laptops at the same price bracket with little or no changes.
       The only purpose of this guide is to help you out in choosing the best laptop according to your needs and the depths of your pockets(budget friendly).</p>
   <h1>What's make me capable enough to suggest you that required Laptop?</h1>
     <h2>Answer is simple:-</h2>
         <ol class="list">
         <p><li>I have invested a lot time in reading specifications, watching 10s of revies per laptop along with comparision ones and much more,</li>
          <li>I won't directly suggest you one laptop, instead i will help you in rejecting which you don't need. </li></p>
     
         </ol>
     
  <h1>
    Let's begin......</h1>
    
    <p>There are utility parameters click on your prefrences, every utility section is then divided in price range. Why didn't i did in other way around ?, i suggested you to invest a little more so this was better way than other..</p>

    <button class="btn"><a href="L1.html"><img class="image" src="laptopguide.png"></a></button>
  
    <div class="faq">
   <h1> wait, before that let's read some FAQ's, quick ones to help while deciding.</h1>
     <ol>
        <h2> Which processor is better AMD or INTEL? </h2> 
             <p>They both are good in their own domain.
                    
                       AMD is renowned for it's multicore performance which comes handy in multi tasking, rendrending videos, photos, when you need to open 10s of tabs in chrome and specially for streaming where more cores are required. So, preferred by youtubers and editors mostly.
                      INTEL is renowned for its single core performances which comes handy when running less apps or a single software be it be a game, that's why still some old gamers and coders prefers INTEL over AMD
                
                     
                     NOTE:-Choose wisely and look in which category you are.
                    </p>  
             <h2><li>What about i(3, 5, 7, 9) on CPUs and generations(9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) in INTEL?</li> </h2>        
                    <p>The number is directly proportional to the performamce you will get. The higher the generation the more optimized and efficient the processor is. 
                    Try to go for i5 10th gen minimum, it will do most of the work. If you can then do go for higher generation or higher number(min. generation 10th).  
                    NOTE:-If you are willing to learn ML(Machine Learnig), AI(Artifical Intelligence) or Data science then try to but minimum i7 10th gen but if you can go higher then much appreciated.</p>
            
            <h2> <li>What about ryzen(3, 5, 7, 9) on CPUs, series(3000 ,4000 ,5000) and letters(U,H)in AMD?</li> </h2>        
                    <p>Again, the number is directly proportional to the performamce you will get. The higher the series the more optimized and efficient the processor is. H ones are more performamce orientated than U ones. 
                    Try to go for ryzen 5 5000 H series minimum, it will do most of the work. If you can then do go for higher series and H ones or higher number.  
                    NOTE:-If you are willing to learn ML(Machine Learnig), AI(Artifical Intelligence) or Data science then try to but minimum ryzen7 5000 H series but if you can go higher then much appreciated.</p>

    
             <h2>  <li>"I don't/won't play games", Do i need GPU ? </li> </h2>
                   <p>One of the popular questions, GPU isn't all about gaming. GPUs are required for video, photos editing , minning ditigal currency like bitcoins and ethirium, and for graphical work like animations. Some software lke Auto cad etc need GPUs for better working, if you can afford do buy it because no one is certain about future what you might end up doing. 
                   NOTE:- If you are willing to learn ML(Machine Learnig), AI(Artifical Intelligence) or Data science then definitely go for GPUs min 4gb Rtx nvidia 3000 series, if can afford more then much appreciated.</p>
             
            <h2><li>Storage, type SSD or HDD?</li></h2>           
                  <p>HDD is an old generation tech. It is slow in both reading and writting data. Go for SSD instead but if you need a good amount of storage capacity than choose a hybrid that is having a combination of both HDD and SSD. SSD is coastly.
                   There are different type of SSDs:-</p>
                     <ol>
                        <li>SATA SSD</li>
                        <li>PCIe SSD</li>
                        <li>M.2 SSD</li>
                        <li>U.2 SSD</li>
                        <li>NVMe SSD</li>
                     </ol>
                    <p> All these SSDs come in different sizes and vary in read and write speed, NVMe having highest and with generation developement the speed increase.  
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2><li>How much RAM and which One ?</li></h2>  
                        <p>A 8gb is min., for coaders for creators and editors its 16gb will do your work but if you are willing to get more performance out the device then upgarade it, dual channel one that is equal ram in both the sots.
                          In most of the devices the type of ram used is Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic RAM(DDRs), its various versions are:-</p>
                          <ol>
                           <li>DDR SDRAM</li>
                           <li>DDR 2</li>
                           <li>DDR 3</li>
                           <li>DDR 4</li>
                           <li>DDR 5</li>
                          
                        </ol>
                       <p>Higher the version the more power efficient, optimised the ram is. Lastest version DDR 5 has highest frequency which means that they are more capable. You will get DDR 4 in most of the laptops.
                      </p>   
            <h2><li>Which display type and Refresh rate to go for? </li></h2>
               <p>If you are looking for casual gaming then 60 hz pannel will also work, but if you want to play AAAs games and give a shot in E-sports then do definitely go for higher refresh rates like 144hz.
               <br>  If you are planning to buy for videos and photos editting purpose then go with 100% sRGb and prefer OLED(for better darks) or IPS pannels. As more color accuracy is required.
             <br>   For coading  60hz and 65-70% sRGB will do your most of the work. Go for IPS pannels with anti glaring and eye proteching feauters as most of the times you will be on laptops.
                 
                 </p>
                
             <h2><li>Which size(13, 14, 15.6 or 17inches) ?  </li></h2>
                  
                      
                        <li><p>For next level of portability choose 13 inches or 14 inches.</p></li>
                        <li><p>For a content creator or editor i will suggest 17 inches as more details will be visible.</p></li>
                        <li><p>For coding 14inch will do as it becomes portable and light, but i will suggest a 15.6inches as spillting of screen become easy and more details can be seen without putting too much strain on the eyes.</p></li>
                          9

                      </p>

                
                 
            <h2><li>Battery ?  </li></h2>
                <p>Go for a bigger battery. Keep in mind that the higher the specifications are the higher the battery consumption is, you will be getting battery life of 4-5 hours per charge for performance oriented laptops and also that you will be able to get most out of it only when plugged in.
                 If battery is your priority then lower you specs or buy a EVO certified laptop by INTEL. You will be getting integrated GPU in those which isn't that capable enough.</p>
           
             <h2><li>Thermals ?  </li></h2>
                  <p>Go for one having a good thermal management but if it isn't there then do buy cooling pads. Cooler the device is more performace you will get and you can use it for a longer period of time in a sitting and lastly it will increase laptop's life.</p>
             
              <h2><li>Body type?</li></h2>
                   <p> Choose durable build.</p>
                
              <h2><li>Backlit keyboard ?</li></h2>     
              <p>Yes, go for one as it will help to code in dark enviornment, especially in nights.</p>
            
              <h2><li>What about macbooks?</li></h2>
                   <p>They are perfect no doubt about that, but as they have less VRam and sorage options and are bit coastly. If you have enough do invest in it specially for coaders and content creator but if are looking for gaming and ML, AI purpose then big no. Lastly that the service coast and software coast too much, it's a different headache.</p>
            </ol>
          <ul>
            
            <li><p>Final verdict, Keep in mind for what purpose you are buying , second also check that you also have upgaradation option for ram and storage . Try to exceed your budget limit by 5-10 thousand for a better device as it is one time investment for next 3-4 years. The last point, unnessearly going for the higher specifications is as foolish as buying under the specification requirement.</p></li>
